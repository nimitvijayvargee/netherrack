A Compute Module 5 Carrier board to use as a minecraft server!
This is a project that I made once the minecraft server plans began to leave the group chat. I initially planned on using it for minecraft, but the applications can vary from home server, NAS to photo server. \
I plan to use a CM5 board with 4GB RAM. While I did plan on using a no emmc and no wireless module, I had to go for a 32GB and Wireless module because of availability. \
I plan to use a 256GB NVMe SSD for storage, which can be swapped out because of the inbuilt M.2 PCIe port. \
I also plan on adding some IO including USB and HDMI for debug or when I want to use it as a desktop. \
The board is designed to be mounted vertically, with the ports on the side and an acrylic panel on the front, giving it a retro green motherboard with a modern front panel look. \
